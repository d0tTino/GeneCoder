# The content of `test_decode_triple_repeat_valid_inputs_updated` is a refined version
# of the original `test_decode_triple_repeat_valid_inputs` after careful re-evaluation of problematic cases.

# One more case from problem description: Test sequences with varied valid DNA characters ("ATCGATCG").
# This was handled by `test_decode_triple_repeat_varied_dna` which I renamed to `test_decode_triple_repeat_atcgatcg_from_description`
# and used `encode_triple_repeat` to generate the input. This is good.
# The original "AAATTTCCCGGGAAATTTCCCGGG" decodes to "ATCGATCG", which is also a valid test.
# My `test_decode_triple_repeat_varied_dna` (now `test_decode_triple_repeat_atcgatcg_from_description`)
# uses `encode_triple_repeat("ATCGATCG")` which results in "AAATTTGGGCCCGGGAAATTTGGGCCCGGG".
# So, the test `test_decode_triple_repeat_atcgatcg_from_description` is effectively testing this.
# I'll keep the specific test name.
