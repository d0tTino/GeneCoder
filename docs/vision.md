# Vision & Core Concept

GeneCoder aims to demystify DNA-based data storage. The toolkit lets users encode arbitrary data into simulated DNA sequences, decode them back and explore the trade-offs of different encoding strategies. By providing an accessible, hands-on environment, GeneCoder highlights both the promise and the challenges of molecular storage technologies.
