# Development Roadmap

1. **Foundation & Enhancements** – implemented CLI, multiple encoders, error handling and a GUI with asynchronous operations.
2. **Phase 2** – explore additional error correction codes, advanced GC balancing and large file streaming.
3. **Phase 3 & Beyond** – deeper simulation of sequencing errors and integration with bioinformatics tools.
