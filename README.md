# GeneCoder: Simulated DNA Data Encoding & Exploration

**An open, educational software toolkit for simulating DNA data encoding and decoding, bringing the concepts of molecular data storage to your fingertips.**

---

## Current Status: Evolving with New Features! ðŸš€

**GeneCoder has been enhanced with new encoding strategies, error correction, batch processing, and an improved GUI!** (As of latest update)

The toolkit now offers more sophisticated ways to simulate DNA data storage, including GC-content balancing, triple-repeat error correction, and the ability to process multiple files efficiently. The Flet-based GUI has also been updated for better responsiveness and to include these new options.

## Vision & Core Concept

GeneCoder aims to demystify the fascinating world of DNA-based data storage. Our goal is to provide an accessible, hands-on tool that allows users to:

* **Encode** arbitrary text or binary files into simulated DNA sequences (A, T, C, G).
* **Decode** these sequences back into their original data form.
* **Explore** different encoding strategies and understand their trade-offs.
* **Learn** about fundamental concepts like data compression, channel coding, bioinformatics file formats (like FASTA), and the error-prone nature of molecular data â€“ all without needing a wet lab!

**Why does this matter?** DNA boasts theoretical storage densities orders of magnitude greater than current magnetic or silicon-based media (potentially ~1 exabyte per gram!). By simulating the encoding/decoding pipeline, GeneCoder will help learners and enthusiasts grasp both the incredible promise and the inherent challenges of this revolutionary technology.

## Implemented MVP Features

The current version of GeneCoder, built around a Command-Line Interface (CLI), delivers the following core functionalities:

*   **CLI for Encoding & Decoding:** A user-friendly CLI (`src/cli.py`) to perform encoding and decoding operations.
*   **Input Handling:**
    *   Accepts arbitrary binary files as input for encoding (UTF-8 text files are also handled as binary).
*   **Encoding Methods:**
    *   **Base-4 Direct Mapping:** (As described before)
    *   **Huffman-4 Coding:** (As described before)
    *   **GC-Balanced Encoder (`gc_balanced`):**
        *   Aims to produce DNA sequences within a target GC content range (currently fixed at 45-55%) and with a maximum homopolymer run length (currently fixed at 3).
        *   It first attempts to encode data directly (using Base-4 Direct). If constraints are met, the sequence is prefixed with '0'.
        *   If constraints are violated, the input data bits are inverted, re-encoded, and the sequence is prefixed with '1'. This provides an alternative sequence that might meet constraints.
        *   The FASTA header includes `method=gc_balanced`, `gc_min`, `gc_max`, and `max_homopolymer` (target constraint values).
        *   Metrics reported include actual GC content and actual maximum homopolymer length of the payload.
*   **Forward Error Correction (FEC):**
    *   **Triple-Repeat FEC (`--fec triple_repeat`):**
        *   Encodes the output of any primary encoding method by repeating each nucleotide three times (e.g., "ATGC" becomes "AAATTTGGGCC").
        *   During decoding, it uses a majority vote on each triplet to correct single errors within that triplet.
        *   If FEC was used, the FASTA header will include `fec=triple_repeat`.
        *   The decoder reports the number of corrected and uncorrectable errors found in triplets.
*   **Error Detection (Parity):**
    *   Optional parity bit addition for `base4_direct` and `huffman` methods using `--add-parity` (details on rules like `GC_even_A_odd_T` can be found in `error_detection.py`). Parity info is stored in the FASTA header.
*   **Decoding Engine:**
    *   Reliable decoding for all supported methods and FEC combinations.
    *   Error detection for invalid DNA characters.
*   **Output Format:**
    *   **Encoded Data:** Output is in FASTA format (`.fasta`).
        *   The FASTA header line includes metadata: encoding method, original input file name, and any relevant parameters (Huffman table, GC constraints, parity info, FEC method).
    *   **Decoded Data:** The output is the original binary file.
*   **Encoding Metrics Display (CLI):**
    *   Original file size (bytes).
    *   Final Encoded DNA length (nucleotides, after any FEC).
    *   Compression ratio (original bytes / final DNA bytes equivalent).
    *   Achieved bits per nucleotide (based on final DNA length).
    *   For `gc_balanced`: Actual GC content and max homopolymer length of the payload (pre-FEC).
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    *   A Flet-based GUI (`src/flet_app.py`) provides an interactive way to use most encoding/decoding features.
    *   Includes options for GC-Balanced encoding and Triple-Repeat FEC.
    *   GUI operations are now asynchronous for improved responsiveness.
    *   Displays encoding metrics and analysis plots (Huffman codeword lengths, nucleotide frequencies).

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

To use GeneCoder CLI, navigate to the project's root directory. The main script is `src/cli.py`.

**General Command Structure (Batch and Single File):**
`python src/cli.py <command> --input-files <path1> [<path2> ...] [--output-file <path>] [--output-dir <dir>] --method <method_name> [options]`

*   `--input-files`: One or more input files.
*   `--output-file`: Specify for a single input file if not using `--output-dir`.
*   `--output-dir`: Specify for multiple input files, or for a single input if `--output-file` is not used. Output files are named based on input filenames.

**CLI Examples:**

1.  **Encode using Base-4 Direct Mapping (single file):**
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py encode --input-files path/to/your_document.txt --output-file path/to/encoded_base4.fasta --method base4_direct
    ```

2.  **Decode using Base-4 Direct Mapping (single file):**
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py decode --input-files path/to/encoded_base4.fasta --output-file path/to/decoded_document.txt --method base4_direct
    ```

3.  **Encode with Huffman, Parity, and Triple-Repeat FEC (single file to output directory):**
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py encode --input-files path/to/my_data.bin --output-dir encoded_output/ --method huffman --add-parity --fec triple_repeat
    ```
    *Metrics and FEC application details will be printed. FASTA header will include Huffman params, parity info, and `fec=triple_repeat`.*

4.  **Decode a file encoded with Huffman and Triple-Repeat FEC:**
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py decode --input-files encoded_output/my_data.bin.fasta --output-file decoded_data.bin --method huffman
    ```
    *The decoder will automatically detect FEC from the header and apply it before Huffman decoding. Parity checks (if `--check-parity` is added and info exists) occur after FEC and before primary decoding.*

5.  **Batch encode multiple files using GC-Balanced method to a specified directory:**
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py encode --input-files file1.txt notes.md image.png --output-dir gc_encoded_batch/ --method gc_balanced
    ```
    *Output: `gc_encoded_batch/file1.txt.fasta`, `gc_encoded_batch/notes.md.fasta`, etc.*

6.  **Batch decode multiple FASTA files from a directory:**
    ```bash
    python src/cli.py decode --input-files gc_encoded_batch/*.fasta --output-dir decoded_batch/ --method gc_balanced
    ```
    *Output: `decoded_batch/file1_decoded.bin`, `decoded_batch/notes_decoded.bin`, etc. (assuming original input names were file1.txt, notes.md)*


### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Run the Flet application:
```bash
python src/flet_app.py
```
The GUI provides controls for most encoding methods, parity, and Triple-Repeat FEC, along with metric displays and some visual analysis plots. GUI operations are asynchronous to keep the interface responsive.
